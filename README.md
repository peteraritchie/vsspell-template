# VS Spell Template
[![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Pri.Utility.Templates)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pri.Utility.Templates/)

A `dotnet new` template to create a .vsspell file in the current directory.

This template was created so that a solution/project may be created from the command-line that contains a .vsspell file without having to run Visual Studio to create it.

To install:

  `dotnet install Pri.Utility.Templates`

To add a .vsspell file in the current directory:

  `dotnet new vsspell`
